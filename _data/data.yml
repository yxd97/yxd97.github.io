career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Thanks for visiting my website!
      I am an PhD candidate at Cornell ECE, working in Computer Systems Lab under the supervision of
      <a href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/index.html">Prof. Zhiru Zhang</a>.
      My current research focuses on designing flexible and efficient accelerators for sparse workloads
      (e.g, sparse matrix multiply, graph analytics),
      while I am also interested in high-level synthesis (HLS) and design automation.
      I am familiar RTL and HLS design flows, and have rich experience in FPGA prototyping and testing.

      I have fufilled the requirements for an MS degree, and expect to get my Ph.D. degree in Summer 2026.
